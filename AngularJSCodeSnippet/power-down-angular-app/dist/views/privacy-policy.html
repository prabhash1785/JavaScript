This privacy policy explains how we collect data, how that data is used, and the steps we take to ensure the confidentiality of that data. Crimpd does not sell any personal information provided by, or collected from, your use of this service.</p><h3>information gathered by crimpd</h3><p>All web access requests to crimpd.com, or any subdomain of crimpd.com, are logged in standard logging formats. For each request, the following information may be captured:</p><ul><li>IP Address</li><li>Date & time</li><li>Resource requested</li><li>The origin of the web request</li><li>User agent</li><li>Username or session identifier</li><li>Audit information</li></ul><p>All access logs are retained for a minimum of 90 days and may be used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Any personally identifiable information related to this data will never be used without explicit modification to this policy. We strongly believe the right to share information belongs solely to you. As a result, all information obtained through the use of integrations established with third party providers (Google and Facebook) must be explicitly granted by you and cannot be changed without your explicit permission.</p><h3>cookies</h3><p>Like most interactive web sites Crimpd.com uses cookies to enable us to retrieve user details for each visit and to manage user sessions. Cookies are used in some areas of our site to enable the functionality of this area and ease of use for those people visiting. Some of our affiliate partners may also use cookies, we strongly encourage you to read their privacy policies so you understand how they are using this information.</p><h3>security</h3><p>Crimpd is diligent about following industry standard best practices for web applications. This helps to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our services and data. We are strong supporters of the <a href="https://www.owasp.org">Open Web Application Security Project</a> and employ the following technical controls to protect your data.</p><h4>https</h4><p>All connections to crimpd.com are encrypted using TLSv1.0. We also leverage Strict Transport Security to ensure connections adhere to that. If you'd like to see how we stack up, a current report of crimpd.com's SSL implementation can be found <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=crimpd.com&amp;hideResults=on">here</a></p><h4>passwords</h4><p>When registering a new account on crimpd.com that is not tied to Facebook or Google, you must create a password. While we do not implement a strict password policy for users, we do employ industry best practices for the storage of passwords. Each password is hashed using the SHA-512 hashing algorithm in combination with a unique salt and a significantly large number of hash iterations. While this can go a long way to help mitigate the impact of a password breach, the best protection is to choose a strong and unique password to begin with. We urge you to never re-use your passwords, especially on important accounts.</p><h4>cross-site scripting</h4><p>Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks are one of the most prevalent in existence today. In order to ensure that you are not at risk when using Crimpd, we take the following precautions.</p><ul><li>Perform input validation where appropriate</li><li>Perform output encoding on untrusted input</li><li>Leverage the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/">Content Security Policy</a> features of your browser to white list trusted content sources</li></ul><p>Even with those protections in place, XSS does still happen. If you find something, please let us know in accordance with our vulnerability disclosure policy.</p><h4>disclosure of security vulnerabilities</h4><p>We regularly test the servers and code that run Crimpd.com for security vulnerabilities. We also understand that building a 100% secure web application is impossible. As a result, we strongly encourage reporting any security vulnerabilities to <a href="mailto:admin@crimpd.com">admin@crimpd.com</a>. We are committed to the security of our users and will respond to all reported vulnerabilities.</p></div></div></section>
